Introduction to Makefiles
Makefiles are essential tools in the realm of software development, particularly in managing large projects with many source files. They automate the build process by defining dependencies and rules for compiling source code into executable programs or libraries. With Makefiles, developers can streamline the compilation process, saving time and ensuring consistency across different environments.
